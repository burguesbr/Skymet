# Skymet - Full-Stack Weather Application

Skymet is a full-stack web application that provides real-time and forecasted weather data.
Built with a user-friendly interface, it allows users to access detailed weather insights,
save their favorite cities, and dynamically adapts based on user location.
It leverages interactive charts and icons, for a better understanding of weather trends.

This project is my **ITS graduation project** and also my **first ever** full-stack web application, demonstrating my proficiency in both backend and frontend technologies.

## Current Status and Features

This project is actively being developed with the following features already completed and functioning:

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: The app successfully retrieves real-time weather information for any location.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Users can view weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Weather data is displayed using interactive charts and graphs (powered by Recharts) for easy analysis.
- **User Location Detection**: The app automatically detects the user's location using the IP-API service to provide localized weather data.
- **Favorite Cities**: Users can save and quickly access their favorite cities for efficient weather tracking.

Some enhancements are currently being worked on, including user profile management, dynamic backgrounds, and mobile app functionality.

## To Do

These are the features that are planned and are in development or on the roadmap for future releases:

- **ðŸš§WIP!ðŸš§ Statistics Page**: Display historical weather data for selected cities.
- **ðŸš§WIP!ðŸš§ User Profile Page**: Editable user profile with a more refined form design.
- **Autocomplete for Last Searched Cities**: Implement a FIFO array for the most recent cities searched.
- **ðŸš§WIP!ðŸš§ Dynamic Weather Backgrounds**: Add a feature that changes the background based on weather conditions (with smoother transitions).
- **Mobile App Version**: Developing a mobile app that will provide push notifications for real-time weather updates.
- **ðŸš§WIP!ðŸš§ Full User Registration**: User registration functionality with email verification and ability to update user information.
- **ðŸš§WIP!ðŸš§ Five-Day Forecasting**: Adding a detailed forecast for the next five days.

These features are planned for future versions of the app, and I am working on implementing them to further enhance the user experience.
